<h1>CHECKLIST</h1>

<h1> Check List for Monitoring patients</h1>
<p> Currently, COVID-19 is spreading as fast as it can in our Country. We need lot of care to treat the current patients as well. We need a fool proof system to maintain the records of people who are in hospitals as well as in Home Quarantine. 
  So to make this secure we need to record all the data of patient.
  
  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  - Ethereum
  - IPFS
  - Solidity
  - node.js
  - express.js
  - react.js
  - npm
  
  <p>
  So we have Dapp that records the events. You can create a event and strike it when it is completed. So for each of this process we have all the data being secured in blockchain. 
  
  Example-
  
  Consider a patient-A who just got admitted. Now as there are many patients there is chance of tampering/mix of health reocrds of patient-A with B or others. This will greatly affect us. So We take a photo/pdf of patient -A upload it to IPFS and we'll get a hash. Then we store this hash in our Dapp along with patients name and record a transaction. This helps a lot.
